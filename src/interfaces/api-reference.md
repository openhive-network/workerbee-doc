- **🟢 Live Mode Only** - These providers require real-time blockchain data and are only available when using `workerbee.observe`
- **🔵 Live and Past Data Modes** - These providers work with both live data (`workerbee.observe`) and historical data (`workerbee.providePastOperations()`)

Providers are specialized data suppliers that enhance WorkerBee filters by delivering enriched blockchain data directly to your observer callbacks. While filters detect specific events or conditions on the blockchain, providers add contextual data and detailed information about accounts, transactions, blocks, and other blockchain entities.

Providers automatically integrate with filters and deliver their data through the same subscription callback, eliminating the need for separate API calls. This creates a seamless development experience where you can access both event notifications and related data in a single observer. They also are able to reuse already acquired data by filters if possible and avoid additional queries. What's important to note, they start to work only when filter condition matches.
