# API Reference

For a complete TypeScript API reference for WorkerBee you can visit [WorkerBee Wiki](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/workerbee/-/wikis/home).

This document covers all filters & providers, divided into categories, available in the library.

XXX: Remember to embed snippets with lines after `import` (without preceding JSDoc).

## Filters

### 👤 Account Management

#### onAccountsFullManabar

This filter triggers when any of the specified accounts reaches 98% manabar capacity.
The monitored manabar type is specified as the first parameter and can be one of 3 types: `UPVOTE`, `DOWNVOTE`, or `RC`.
The filter provides manabar information for each monitored account in the callback data.
When observing multiple accounts, remember to check if manabar data is available for the specific account.
This filter is only available when working with live data.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onAccountsFullManabar() — notify when accounts reach 98% manabar.
 *
 * This observer monitors manabar levels and triggers when any specified account reaches 98% manabar capacity.
 * You can specify a manabar kind to be monitored (expressed by values of {@link EManabarType}).
 * Multiple account names can be observed at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `manabarType: EManabarType` - The type of manabar to monitor (RC, UPVOTE, or DOWNVOTE)
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for full manabar
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IManabarProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import { EManabarType } from "@hiveio/wax";
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for accounts with full RC manabar...");

bot.observe.onAccountsFullManabar(EManabarType.RC, "guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when either guest4test or guest4test1 reaches 98% RC manabar.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IManabarProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.manabarData` - Contains manabar information for each monitored account
   * The callback receives data for all monitored account even if only one reaches 98% manabar.
   * The rest of the accounts will point to undefined so you should check for their existence before accessing their properties.
   */
  next(data) {
    if (data.manabarData.guest4test)
      console.log(`⚡ Account guest4test has ${data.manabarData.guest4test?.[EManabarType.RC]?.percent}% RC manabar!`);
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onAccountsManabarPercent

This filter works similarly to [`onAccountsFullManabar`](#onaccountsfullmanabar), but allows you to specify a custom manabar percentage threshold.
It provides the account's manabar data in the callback and is also available only in live data mode.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onAccountsManabarPercent() — watch for manabar threshold percentage.
 *
 * This observer triggers when accounts reach a specific manabar percentage threshold.
 * You can specify a manabar kind to be monitored (expressed by values of {@link EManabarType}).
 * Multiple account names can be observed at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `manabarType: EManabarType` - The type of manabar to monitor (RC, UPVOTE, or DOWNVOTE)
 * - `percent: number` - The percentage threshold to trigger on (0-100)
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for threshold
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IManabarProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import { EManabarType } from "@hiveio/wax";
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for accounts with 90%+ RC manabar...");

bot.observe.onAccountsManabarPercent(EManabarType.RC, 90, "guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when either guest4test or guest4test1 reaches 90% RC manabar.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IManabarProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.manabarData` - Contains manabar information for each monitored account
   * The callback receives data for all monitored accounts even if only one reaches the threshold.
   * The rest of the accounts will point to undefined so you should check for their existence before accessing their properties.
   */
  next(data) {
    if (data.manabarData.guest4test)
      console.log(`🔋 Account guest4test has ${data.manabarData.guest4test?.[EManabarType.RC]?.percent}% RC manabar!`);
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onAccountsMetadataChange

This filter triggers when any of the specified accounts updates their metadata.
It is available in both live and past data modes.
You can observe multiple accounts in a single observer call.
XXX: Remember to update description here when this filter will provide some callback data

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onAccountsMetadataChange() — watch accounts for metadata updates.
 *
 * This observer triggers when accounts update their profile data or other metadata via account_update operations.
 * Multiple account names can be observed at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for metadata changes
 *
 * There is no callback data for this observer.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for account metadata changes...");

bot.observe.onAccountsMetadataChange("guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when guest4test or guest4test1 updates their account metadata.
   * Account metadata changes include profile updates.
   * There is no callback data for this observer - it simply notifies when any of monitored accounts change the metadata.
   */
  next() {
    console.log("👤 Account metadata changed");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onImpactedAccounts

This filter triggers when any new blockchain operation affects one of the specified accounts (transfers, votes, mentions, etc.).
You can monitor multiple accounts in both live and past data modes.
Remember to check if data for a specific account actually exists when observing multiple accounts.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onImpactedAccounts() — monitor all operations affecting accounts.
 *
 * This observer triggers when ANY operation affects the specified accounts
 * (transfers, votes received, mentions, follows, etc.). This provides comprehensive
 * account activity monitoring across all operation types.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for any activity
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IImpactedAccountProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for account impacts...");

bot.observe.onImpactedAccounts("guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when guest4test or guest4test1 is affected by any blockchain operation.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IImpactedAccountProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.impactedAccounts` - Contains operations that impacted each monitored account
   * Each account's data contains arrays of operation-transaction pairs affecting that account.
   * The callback receives data for all monitored accounts even if only one is impacted,
   * but the content for account that is not impacted will be undefined.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.impactedAccounts.guest4test?.forEach(({ operation }) => {
      console.log(`💥 Account guest4test impacted in operation: ${operation}`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onNewAccount

This filter triggers when new accounts are created on the blockchain through account creation operations.
It monitors three types of account creation operations: `account_create_operation`, `account_create_with_delegation_operation`, and `create_claimed_account_operation`.
The filter requires no input parameters as it monitors all new account creations globally.
It is available in both live and past data modes.
The callback data includes detailed information about each newly created account, including the account name, creator, authorities, and metadata.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onNewAccount() — monitor newly created accounts.
 *
 * This observer triggers when new accounts are created on the blockchain via
 * account_create or account_create_with_delegation operations. No input parameters
 * required as it monitors all new account creations.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all new account creations)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link INewAccountProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for new accounts...");

bot.observe.onNewAccount().subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when any new account is created on the blockchain.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link INewAccountProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.newAccounts` - Array of newly created account data with account details
   * Each new account object contains information like accountName, creator, and creation details.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.newAccounts.forEach(account => {
      console.log(`👶 New account created: - ${account.accountName} by ${account.creator}`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

### ⚙️ Blockchain Infrastructure

#### onBlockNumber

This filter triggers when the blockchain reaches a specific block number.
It is useful for scheduled operations, testing scenarios, or waiting for governance proposals that become active at a particular block.
The filter takes a single block number parameter and monitors the blockchain until that exact block is produced.
It is available in both live and past data modes.
The filter provides no callback data as it is designed to be a simple notification mechanism - if you need block details, combine it with block providers.
XXX: Add link to block provider

``` ts
/**
 * Category: ⚙️ Blockchain Infrastructure
 * Demo: onBlockNumber() — wait for a specific upcoming block number.
 *
 * This observer triggers when a specific block number is reached.
 * Useful for scheduled operations, testing, or waiting for governance proposals.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `blockNumber: number` - The specific block number to wait for
 *
 * There is no callback data for this observer.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

// Wait for a future block (adjust this number as needed)
const targetBlock = 99999999;

console.log(`⏳ Waiting for block #${targetBlock}...`);

bot.observe.onBlockNumber(targetBlock).subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when the blockchain reaches the specified block number.
   * Useful for scheduled operations, testing, or waiting for governance proposals.
   * There is no callback data for this observer - it simply notifies when the target block is reached.
   * The main concept of this observer is to observe for specific block without a need of calling get_block API
   * This is why the block header data is also not available in the callback.
   */
  next() {
    console.log("🎯 Target block reached!");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onBlock

This filter triggers on every new block produced on the blockchain.
Unlike [`onBlockNumber`](#onblocknumber) which waits for a specific block number to be reached and then triggers once, `onBlock` continuously monitors the blockchain and triggers for every single block that gets produced.
It provides comprehensive block header data in the callback, making it perfect for real-time blockchain monitoring and applications that need to process every block.
The filter requires no input parameters and is available in both live and past data modes.
When processing past data, it will trigger for each block in the specified range, allowing you to replay blockchain history.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: ⚙️ Blockchain Infrastructure
 * Demo: onBlock() — logs new block headers for a short duration.
 *
 * This is the foundational snippet that demonstrates WorkerBee's core concepts.
 * The observer triggers on every new block and provides comprehensive block header data.
 * No input parameters required as it monitors all blocks.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all new blocks)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IBlockHeaderProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Listening for new blocks...");

bot.observe.onBlock().subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger on every new block produced on the blockchain.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IBlockHeaderProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.block` - Contains complete block header information like id, number and timestamp
   */
  next(data) {
    console.log(`📦 Block #${data.block.number} id=${data.block.id} time=${data.block.timestamp}`);
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onTransactionIds

This filter triggers when specific transaction IDs appear on the blockchain.
It is particularly useful for tracking the inclusion of specific transactions in blocks, monitoring transaction confirmations, or building applications that need to react when certain transactions are processed.
You can monitor multiple transaction IDs simultaneously, and the filter will trigger when any of them appears on the blockchain.
The filter is available in both live and past data modes, making it perfect for both real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
The callback provides detailed transaction data for each monitored transaction ID, allowing you to access the full transaction content and metadata.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: ⚙️ Blockchain Infrastructure
 * Demo: onTransactionIds() — monitor specific transaction IDs.
 *
 * This observer triggers when specific transaction IDs appear on the blockchain.
 * Useful for tracking specific transactions and their inclusion in blocks.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...transactionIds: string[]` - Transaction IDs to monitor
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link ITransactionProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for specific transaction IDs...");

// Example transaction IDs (replace with actual ones)
bot.observe.onTransactionIds("example-tx-id-1", "example-tx-id-2").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when any of the specified transaction IDs appear on the blockchain.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link ITransactionProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.transactions` - Contains transaction data for each found transaction ID
   * All transaction IDs will be present in the data object, but those not found will have undefined values.
   * You should check for the existence of each transaction before accessing its properties when observing multiple IDs.
   */
  next(data) {
    if (data.transactions["example-tx-id-1"])
      console.log("🔍 Transaction found: example-tx-id-1");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

### 🏦 Financial Operations

#### onAccountsBalanceChange

This filter triggers when account balances change due to various financial operations on the blockchain.
It monitors all types of balance modifications including incoming and outgoing transfers, author/curation rewards, witness rewards, power ups/downs, savings operations, and conversions.
The filter allows you to specify whether to include internal balance changes through the `includeInternal` parameter.
You can monitor multiple accounts simultaneously, making it perfect for portfolio tracking, payment processing, or automated financial applications.
The filter is available in both live and past data modes, allowing you to track balance changes in real-time or analyze historical financial activity.
XXX: Update description when callback data will be available

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onAccountsBalanceChange() — monitor account balance updates.
 *
 * This observer triggers when account balances change due to transfers, rewards,
 * or other financial operations. You can specify whether to include internal
 * balance changes and monitor multiple accounts.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `includeInternal: boolean` - Whether to include internal balance changes
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for balance changes
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * There is no callback data for this observer.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for balance changes...");

bot.observe.onAccountsBalanceChange(true, "guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when guest4test or guest4test1 has a balance change.
   * Balance changes include transfers, rewards, power ups/downs, and savings operations.
   * There is no callback data for this observer - it simply notifies when the change in any of monitored accounts occurs.
   */
  next() {
    console.log("💰 Balance changed");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onExchangeTransfer

This filter triggers when transfers involve known cryptocurrency exchange accounts on the Hive blockchain.
WorkerBee maintains an internal list of recognized exchange accounts and automatically monitors all transfer operations that either originate from or are directed to these exchanges.
XXX: `to` is not implemented yet
This is particularly useful for tracking market movements, analyzing trading patterns, detecting large deposits/withdrawals, or building exchange monitoring applications.
The filter requires no input parameters as it globally monitors all exchange-related transfers, making it ideal for market analysis and trading bot applications.
It provides detailed transfer data including amounts, sender/receiver information, and memo fields, allowing you to analyze exchange activity patterns.
The filter is available in both live and past data modes.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onExchangeTransfer() — monitor transfers to/from known exchanges.
 *
 * This observer triggers when transfers involve known exchange accounts.
 * WorkerBee maintains a list of known exchanges automatically, monitoring
 * both deposits to and withdrawals from these exchange accounts.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all transfers involving known exchanges)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IExchangeTransferProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for exchange transfers...");

bot.observe.onExchangeTransfer().subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when transfers involve known exchange accounts.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IExchangeTransferProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.exchangeTransferOperations` - Array of transfer-operation pairs involving exchanges
   * Each transaction/operation contains transfer details with standard hive transfer properties.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.exchangeTransferOperations.forEach(({ operation }) => {
      console.log(`🏦 Exchange transfer: ${operation.from} -> ${operation.to} (${operation.amount})`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onFeedPriceChange

This filter triggers when the Hive price feed changes by a specified percentage threshold.
It monitors the official price feed data published by witnesses and detects significant price movements that exceed your defined percentage threshold.
This is particularly useful for building trading bots, price alert systems, or applications that need to react to market volatility.
The filter allows you to set a custom percentage threshold (e.g., 5 for 5% change) to control the sensitivity of price change detection.
It's perfect for monitoring market conditions without constantly polling price data, and works with both live and past data modes.
The filter is essential for financial applications that need to respond to significant price movements on the Hive blockchain.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onFeedPriceChange() — monitor when feed price changes by percentage.
 *
 * This observer triggers when the Hive price feed changes by a specified percentage
 * threshold. Useful for monitoring significant market movements and price volatility.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `percentThreshold: number` - Minimum percentage change required to trigger (e.g., 5 for 5%)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives no data.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for price changes (5%+)...");

bot.observe.onFeedPriceChange(5).subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when the Hive price feed changes by 5% or more.
   * The callback receives no data.
   */
  next() {
    console.log("📈 Price changed by 5%+");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onFeedPriceNoChange

This filter triggers when the Hive price feed remains completely unchanged for a specified number of hours.
Unlike [`onFeedPriceChange`](#onfeedpricechange) which detects price movements, this filter is designed to detect periods of price stability and low market volatility.
The filter monitors the price history feed data and checks if the exact same price value has been maintained for the specified duration.
This is particularly useful for detecting market stagnation, low trading volume periods, or identifying optimal times for certain trading strategies that work best in stable market conditions.
The filter accepts a parameter specifying the number of hours of required stability, with a default of 24 hours if no parameter is provided.
It works with both live and past data modes, making it valuable for both real-time monitoring and historical market analysis.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onFeedPriceNoChange() — monitor when feed price stays stable.
 *
 * This observer triggers when the Hive price feed remains stable (unchanged)
 * for a specified number of hours. Useful for detecting periods of low volatility.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `hours: number` - Number of hours of required price stability to trigger
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives no data.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for price stability (24h+)...");

bot.observe.onFeedPriceNoChange(24).subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when the Hive price feed remains stable for 24 hours.
   * The callback receives no data.
   */
  next() {
    console.log("🧊 Price stable for 24h");
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onInternalMarketOperation

This filter triggers when operations occur on Hive's built-in internal decentralized exchange (DEX) for HIVE ↔ HBD trading.
It monitors three specific types of market operations: limit order creation, order cancellation, and automatic order fills when orders are matched.
The internal market allows users to trade between HIVE and HBD (Hive Backed Dollars) directly on the blockchain without using external exchanges.
This filter is particularly useful for building market analysis tools, arbitrage bots, trading dashboards, or applications that need to track decentralized trading activity.
The filter requires no input parameters as it globally monitors all internal market operations, providing comprehensive coverage of the built-in DEX activity.
It works with both live and past data modes, making it valuable for real-time trading applications and historical market analysis.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onInternalMarketOperation() — monitor internal market activity.
 *
 * This observer monitors the Hive internal market for limit order creation,
 * cancellation, and order fills. Tracks HIVE ↔ HBD trading activity on the
 * built-in decentralized exchange.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all internal market operations)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IInternalMarketProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for internal market operations...");

bot.observe.onInternalMarketOperation().subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when internal market operations occur (order create/cancel/fill).
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IInternalMarketProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.internalMarketOperations` - Array of market transaction/operation pairs (create/cancel/fill)
   * Each transaction/operation follows either {@link IInternalMarketCreateOperation}.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.internalMarketOperations.forEach(({ operation }) => {
      console.log(`🏪 Market operation: ${operation.owner}, order ${operation.orderId}`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onWhaleAlert

This filter triggers when large transfers exceed a specified amount threshold, making it perfect for monitoring significant financial movements on the Hive blockchain.
It monitors four specific types of transfer operations: regular transfers, transfers from savings, escrow transfers, and recurrent transfers.
The filter is commonly known as "whale watching" in crypto communities, as it helps detect when large holders (whales) move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency.
You can specify any asset type and amount threshold using the chain's helper methods like `bot.chain.hiveCoins(1000)`.
This filter is particularly useful for market analysis, detecting potential market-moving transactions, building trading alerts, or monitoring large account movements for security purposes.
It works with both live and past data modes, providing comprehensive coverage for financial surveillance and analysis applications.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onWhaleAlert() — monitor large transfers above a threshold.
 *
 * This observer triggers when transfers exceed a specified amount threshold,
 * useful for monitoring large financial movements on the blockchain.
 * The threshold can be specified for any supported asset type.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `threshold: asset` - Minimum transfer amount to trigger alert (use bot.chain.hiveCoins() or similar)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IWhaleAlertProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

/*
 * Monitor transfers of 1000 HIVE or more
 * Remember that chain is available only after calling `start` method.
 */
const threshold = bot.chain!.hiveCoins(1000);

console.log("⏳ Watching for whale transfers (1000+ HIVE)...");

bot.observe.onWhaleAlert(threshold).subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when any transfer exceeds the specified threshold amount.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IWhaleAlertProviderData}, which includes:
   * - `data.whaleOperations` - Array of large transfer transaction-operation pairs exceeding the threshold
   * You can access each transaction/operation that contains details like from, to, amount, and memo.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.whaleOperations.forEach(({ operation }) => {
      console.log(`🐋 Whale alert: ${operation.from} -> ${operation.to} (${operation.amount})`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

### 🔐 Security & Governance

#### onAlarm

This filter triggers when monitored accounts experience security or governance-related situations that require attention.
It detects five specific alarm types: legacy recovery account configuration (accounts still using "steem" as recovery account from old blockchain), expired governance votes (accounts that haven't participated in governance for extended periods), upcoming governance vote expiration (within one month), active recovery account changes (during the 30-day waiting period), and accounts that have declined their voting rights.
The filter is essential for account security monitoring, governance participation tracking, and detecting potentially compromised or misconfigured accounts.
You can monitor multiple accounts simultaneously, making it perfect for wallet applications, account management tools, or security monitoring systems.
It works with both live and past data modes, allowing you to track security events in real-time or analyze historical governance patterns.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🔐 Security & Governance
 * Demo: onAlarm() — monitor governance and security alarms.
 *
 * This observer triggers on various governance and security events like recovery
 * account changes, governance votes, witness actions, and other security-related
 * operations. Multiple accounts can be monitored simultaneously.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for security and governance events
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IAlarmAccountsData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 */
import WorkerBee from "@hiveio/workerbee";

const bot = new WorkerBee();
await bot.start();

console.log("⏳ Watching for governance alarms...");

bot.observe.onAlarm("guest4test", "guest4test1").subscribe({
  /*
   * This observer will trigger when security or governance events occur for guest4test or guest4test1.
   * The callback receives data of type {@link IAlarmAccountsData}, which includes:
   * - `data.alarmsPerAccount` - Contains alarm information grouped by account
   * Each account's alarms follow the {@link TAlarmAccounts} structure with {@link EAlarmType} categorization.
   */
  next(data) {
    data.alarmsPerAccount.guest4test?.forEach(alarm => {
      console.log(`🚨 Governance alarm for guest4test: ${alarm}`);
    });
    data.alarmsPerAccount.guest4test1?.forEach(alarm => {
      console.log(`🚨 Governance alarm for guest4test1: ${alarm}`);
    });
  },
  error: console.error
});
```

#### onWitnessesMissedBlocks

This filter triggers when specified witness accounts miss a threshold number of consecutive blocks during their scheduled block production turns.
It monitors witness performance by tracking the `totalMissedBlocks` counter and `lastConfirmedBlockNum` to detect when witnesses fail to produce blocks when they're supposed to.
The filter is essential for network health monitoring, witness performance analysis, and detecting potential issues with witness nodes (server downtime, connectivity problems, or configuration issues).
It intelligently resets its tracking when a witness successfully produces a block again, preventing duplicate notifications for the same missed block streak.
You can monitor multiple witnesses simultaneously with different threshold values, making it perfect for witness monitoring dashboards, alerting systems, or blockchain infrastructure monitoring tools.
The filter works with both live and past data modes, allowing you to analyze historical witness performance or monitor real-time witness reliability.

``` ts
/**
 * Category: 🔐 Security & Governance
 * Demo: onWitnessesMissedBlocks() — monitor when witnesses miss blocks.
 *
 * This observer triggers when specified witnesses miss a certain number of blocks.
 * Essential for monitoring network health and witness performance. Can track
 * multiple witnesses simultaneously.
 *
