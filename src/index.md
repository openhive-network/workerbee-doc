# Intro to WorkerBee library

**A powerful and flexible Hive automation library.**

WorkerBee, based on `wax`, provides a simple yet powerful interface to interact with the Hive blockchain, allowing you to build sophisticated bots and automation scripts with ease.

---

## ✨ Features

- **No More Endless Loops!** 🔄 Just say what you want to listen to - WorkerBee does all the waiting and event handling behind the scenes.
- **No Blockchain Headaches!** 🧩 Forget complicated APIs and coding tricks. Write logic much like you would on regular web apps (think: “When a new post appears by Alice, send me a ping!”).
- **Keep Your Sandbox Clean** 🧼 WorkerBee shields your code from the messy details of blockchain data, so your app stays flexible and easy-to-maintain.
- **One Interface, Many Sources** 🗃️ Switch from live blockchain data to a historical database or new data source (e.g. SQL) - all without changing your app’s logic!
- **Easy to Expand** 📈 Start simple but add new events, rules, or channels as your needs grow.
- **Fully typed** ℹ️ Library APIs have well defined types and functional interfaces with special support for IDE IntelliSense
